# Lichen Microbiomes

Pipeline for the analysis of Lichen microbiomes
> * Identify commensal bacteria associated with Lichen thalli
> * Get richness and diversity measures of Lichen genera
> * Compare lichen microbiomes and identify core OTUs
 
 
 ## Organization of this repository

 This repository contains the following directories:

[Alpha-diversity](https://github.com/mariaasierra/Lichen_Microbiome/tree/master/Alpha-diversity). Rarefaction, diversity indices, abundance plots and diversity cladograms
 
[Beta-diversity](https://github.com/mariaasierra/Lichen_Microbiome/tree/master/Beta-diversity). Includes differentially analysis for microbiomes comparison 

[Core-microbiome](https://github.com/mariaasierra/Lichen_Microbiome/tree/master/Core-microbiome). Includes prevalence of OTUs and core taxa
