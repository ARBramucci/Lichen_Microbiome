# Beta diversity 
We compare the microbiomes of seven Lichen genera through a differential abundance analysis. 

Files are available on the [Data](https://github.com/alehsierra/Lichen_Microbiome/tree/master/Data) folder.

You would also need the following R packages:

>`Library(phyloseq)`
>
>`Library(ALDEx2)`
>
>`library(ggstance)`
